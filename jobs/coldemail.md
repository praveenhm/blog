### Template 1: The Direct "Soham" Style (Bold & Passionate)

This one is very close to the original. Use it for early-stage startups where you want to show raw passion and a builder's mindset.

**Subject:** AI/ML Engineer for [Company Name]

**tldr;**
I'm obsessed with taking ML models from notebooks to robust, large-scale production systems. I don't just build models; I build the infrastructure on AWS/GCP with K8s to make them reliable and scalable. Your mission at [Company Name] is compelling, and I want to be heads down building the AI systems that get you from 1 -> 100.

Hi [Founder's Name],

I've been following what you're building at [Company Name] and I'm incredibly impressed by your approach to [mention a specific product, mission, or problem they are solving].

I'm reaching out to see if you're looking for an AI/ML Engineer to join your early team. I have [X] years of experience designing, building, and deploying large-scale machine learning systems from the ground up. At previous roles, I've helped scale ML infrastructure for [mention a specific outcome, e.g., "millions of users," "petabytes of data," or "real-time inference"].

My core strength lies in bridging the gap between ML research and production-grade engineering. I have hands-on experience across the MLOps stack:
*   **Infrastructure:** Architecting and managing scalable compute on **AWS** and **GCP** using **Kubernetes (K8s)**, Terraform, and Docker.
*   **Pipelines:** Building distributed data processing and model training pipelines (e.g., using Kubeflow, Airflow, Spark).
*   **Deployment:** Deploying and monitoring low-latency inference services for models (e.g., NLP, CV, recommendation engines).

I would love the opportunity to be a part of the foundational team at [Company Name] and help define its ML infrastructure and culture.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2: The "Problem/Solution" Approach (More Consultative)

This template is great when you can identify a specific challenge the startup might be facing. It shows you've done your homework.

**Subject:** Scaling ML infrastructure at [Company Name]

Hi [Founder's Name],

I've been following [Company Name]'s recent launch of [mention a specific AI-powered feature or product]. Scaling a feature like that often introduces significant challenges around model deployment, inference latency, and maintaining training infrastructure.

I specialize in solving exactly these kinds of problems. As an AI/ML engineer with a background in large-scale systems, I've spent the last [X] years building the robust cloud infrastructure needed to support production machine learning.

For example, at [Your Previous Company/Project], I led the effort to [mention a specific, relevant achievement, e.g., "reduce our model inference latency by 60% by migrating our services to a custom GKE cluster" or "build an automated retraining pipeline on AWS SageMaker that cut down our model deployment time from weeks to hours"].

My experience is heavily focused on the tools you're likely using or will need:
*   **Cloud:** Deep experience with both **AWS** (SageMaker, S3, EKS) and **GCP** (Vertex AI, GCS, GKE).
*   **Orchestration:** Hands-on expertise with **Kubernetes (K8s)** for deploying and scaling complex ML workloads.
*   **MLOps:** Proficient in building the end-to-end stack, from data ingestion to model monitoring.

I'm confident I could help you accelerate your product roadmap by building a scalable and reliable ML platform. Would you be open to a brief chat next week?

Best,

### Key Things to Customize Before Sending:

1.  **[Founder's Name]:** Always find the founder's first name. Never use "To whom it may concern" or "Dear Hiring Manager."
2.  **[Company Name]:** Simple, but double-check the spelling.
3.  **[Mention a specific product, mission, or problem]:** This is the MOST important part. It shows you're not just spamming. Spend 5 minutes on their website or news articles. What did they just launch? What is their core mission statement? Mention it.
4.  **[X] years of experience:** Be honest.
5.  **[Mention a specific outcome...]:** Quantify your impact. Instead of "I worked on ML models," say "I deployed a recommendation engine that increased user engagement by 15%."
6.  **Your Links:** Make sure your LinkedIn is updated and your GitHub has a clean README and showcases relevant projects.
