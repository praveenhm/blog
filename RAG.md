###################### Course on RAG


The RAG Implementation Reality

What you're experiencing right now:



❌ Your RAG demo impressed stakeholders, but real users encounter hallucinations when they need accuracy most

❌ Engineers spend countless hours tweaking prompts with minimal improvement

❌ Colleagues report finding information manually that your system failed to retrieve

❌ You keep making changes but have no way to measure if they're actually helping

❌ Every improvement feels like guesswork instead of systematic progress

❌ You're unsure which 10% of possible enhancements will deliver 90% of the value



What your RAG system could be:

With the RAG Flywheel methodology, you'll build a system that:



✅ Retrieves the right information even for complex, ambiguous queries

✅ Continuously improves with each user interaction

✅ Provides clear metrics to demonstrate ROI to stakeholders

✅ Allows your team to make data-driven decisions about improvements

✅ Adapts to different content types with specialized capabilities

✅ Creates value that compounds over time instead of degrading



What Makes This Course Different

Unlike courses that focus solely on technical implementation, this program gives you the systematic, data-driven approach used by companies to transform prototypes into production systems that deliver real business value:



✅ The Improvement Flywheel: Build synthetic evaluation data that identifies exactly what's failing in your system—even before you have users

✅ Fine-tuning Framework: Create custom embedding models with minimal data (as few as 6,000 examples)

✅ Feedback Acceleration: Design interfaces that collect 5x more high-quality feedback without annoying users

✅ Segmentation System: Analyze user queries to identify which segments need specialized retrievers for 20-40% accuracy gains

✅ Multimodal Architecture: Implement specialized indices for different content types (documents, images, tables)

✅ Query Routing: Create a unified system that intelligently selects the right retriever for each query



The Complete RAG Implementation Framework



Week 1: Evaluation Systems

Build synthetic datasets that pinpoint RAG failures instead of relying on subjective assessments


BEFORE: "We need to make the AI better, but we don't know where to start."
AFTER: "We know exactly which query types are failing and by how much."


Week 2: Fine-tune Embeddings

Customize models for 20-40% accuracy gains with minimal examples


BEFORE: "Generic embeddings don't understand our domain terminology."
AFTER: "Our embedding models understand exactly what 'similar' means in our business context."


Week 3: Feedback Systems

Design interfaces that collect 5x more feedback without annoying users


BEFORE: "Users get frustrated waiting for responses and rarely tell us what's wrong."
AFTER: "Every interaction provides signals that strengthen our system."


Week 4: Query Segmentation

Identify high-impact improvements and prioritize engineering resources


BEFORE: "We don't know which features would deliver the most value."
AFTER: "We have a clear roadmap based on actual usage patterns and economic impact."



Week 5: Specialized Search

Build specialized indices for different content types that improve retrieval


BEFORE: "Our system struggles with anything beyond basic text documents."
AFTER: "We can retrieve information from tables, images, and complex documents with high precision."


Week 6: Query Routing

Implement intelligent routing that selects optimal retrievers automatically


BEFORE: "Different content requires different interfaces, creating a fragmented experience."
AFTER: "Users have a seamless experience while the system intelligently routes to specialized components."



Real-world Impact From Implementation

✅ 85% blueprint image recall: Construction company using visual LLM captioning

✅ 90% research report retrieval: Through better text preprocessing techniques

✅ $50M revenue increase: Retail company enhancing product search with embedding fine-tuning

✅ +14% accuracy boost: Fine-tuning cross-encoders with minimal examples

✅ +20% response accuracy: Using re-ranking techniques

✅ -30% irrelevant documents: Through improved query segmentation
